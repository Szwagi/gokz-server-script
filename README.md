A PowerShell script that sets up and updates all the components of a GOKZ server.
It can also symlink game folders to the server, which is useful for mapping.

1. Copy gokz.ps1 to a folder, that is your launch script.
2. Open the script in any text editor and make sure you like the settings at the top of the file.
3. Right click the file and **Run with PowerShell**.
4. Everything will be set up and the server will launch
5. Every time you want to start the server, start it with the script as well, it will keep updating everything.

*Installing to directories that need admin privileges (like Program Files) is untested.*
